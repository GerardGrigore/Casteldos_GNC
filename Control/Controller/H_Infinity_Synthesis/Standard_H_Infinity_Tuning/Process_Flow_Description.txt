The following documents serves to describe how to use the functions and 
scripts available in this repository, in order to design an optimal
H_Infinity tuned controller of 2 degrees of freedom (DoF). 2 DoF
due to the fact that the synthetized controller will produce a command of the
form:

 U(s) = K1(s)*(Heading_Aimed - Heading_Observed) - K2(s)*Heading_Observed
 U(s) = K1(s)*Error(s) - K2(s)*Heading_Observed

Whereas the classical 1 DoF would be only the first term with K2(s) = 0.

The Standard method used for the synthesis imply the use of filters in order
to shape the differents transfers of the control loop. For example, to
shape the transfer of the reference Heading to the Error of the loop. Or
the input disturbance of the wave to the output measurement Heading.

For that, the parameters of the filters must be tuned. It can be done "by-hand".
But an optization algorithm can be used too, if the requirements on the loop
response are effectively translated into constraint functions.

In order to find the optimal parameters of the filters for the synthesis, one must
launch the following script:
* Controller_Stochastic_Optimization.m that calls for the algorithm
  Cost_Function_Optimal_Tuning_Controller.m in which the requirements
  and the constraints function are established.

The obtained parameters of the filters after the optimization are embedded in
the script Standard_H_Infinity_Controller_Tuning.m. Then, it is possible to
search for a corrector of a reduced order. Indeed, the controller generated by
the synthesis is of order of the plant, augmented by the filters. Therefore,
it can reach up an order to 7. Hence, in order to reduce the order of the obtained
controller, one must then inject the obtained parameters in the script 
Standard_H_Infinity_Controller_Tuning.m (as previously mentioned), launch it, and then
launch the script Aposteriori_Corrector_Order_Reduction.m.

Eventually, the scripts:
* Frequency_Responses.m
* Temporal_Responses.m
Can be used to observe the diffenrent frequency responses of the loop and the temporal
responses as well. This in order to check if the requirements expressed in the beginning
of the synthesis are verified.

% The Simulink models:
* Ship_Control_Loop_H_Infinity_Standard.slx
* Ship_Control_Loop_H_Infinity_Standard_Saturation.slx
* Ship_Control_Loop_H_Infinity_Standard_Controller_Comparison.slx
Are used to test the obtained controller.
