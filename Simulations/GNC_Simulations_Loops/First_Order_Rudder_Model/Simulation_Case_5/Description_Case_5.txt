Composition of the 'Simulation_Case_6' closed loop simulation:

- This simulator contains approximately the same information and functionnalities than
  its previous version 'Simulation_Case_4'. The novelty is in the wind perturbation addition
  and a wind estimator allowing to take into account the wind in the rudder action of 
  the corrector.

Neglected elements:

- No actuator model.

Conclusions:
------------

- If the wind perturbation is activated, injected into the system but not estimated nor
  taken into account in the rudder command controller; the system still behave well but with
  a more important amount of parasite in the heading.

- If the wind perturbation is activated, injected into the system and estimated perfectly
  (using a Go to/From), then it is possible to inject it in the PIDF controller and impose 
  that Rudder_Commanded = Rudder_PIDF - Rudder_Induced_Wind.

- The major problem here is that the wind effects is created using a torque wind profile. It is
  then converted into heading value and injected into the heading that goes outside of the 
  Ship trasnfer function. However, that is not physically realistic. The profile of heading
  induced by the wind suggests an increasing value (up to angles values >>> 2*pi) in a polynomial
  function of time.
  There is a need to be able to model an impact of the wind on the system in terms of local
  torque creation. The fact is that this occurs "inside" the Nomoto transfer function and that
  it must be modified (maybe to be of MISO function (input 1: wind, input 2: rudder angle)).

  ==> A solution: Performance/Robustness tested by dispersing the values of N_Delta. Indeed,
                  by knowing an estimate of Torque_Wind, it is mathematically possible to state
                  that Rudder_Induced_Wind = Estimate_Torque_Wind/N_Delta. Hence, possible
                  to apply in the controller: Rudder_Commanded = Rudder_PIDF - Rudder_Induced_Wind.

- In reality: a bias term accounting for the wind has been added in the Kalman filter. In
  addition, by setting up a very high value of wind velocity, performance can be assured.
  However, this is done by not dispersing the value of N_Delta. We can see that if we increase
  this value of hydrodynamic coefficient, with very important winds, the saturated controller
  is unable to produce a soltion.
