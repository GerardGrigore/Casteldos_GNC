Conclusions:
------------

- Important note: if the Guidance frequency is too high, the heading generated
  profile can present some abrupt values and brutal picks. This can result in a 
  destabilization of the controlled heading. An aggravating factor is the online
  estimation of the wave perturbation pulsation. Therefore, if the online estimation
  is activated, there is a need to increase the period of the Guidance algorithm:
  therefore decreasing its frequence.

- If the heading variance of the model is fixed to a low value, it means that we 
  suppose to have a great confidence in our heading variation model. However, in this
  first simple EKF model, we have chosen a simple heading angle to be equal to its previous
  value. Therefore, if the associated variance is too low: the filter might diverge because
  it will try to choose some values of heading that are very close from one step to another;
  which is infact not the case. There is a need to embbed a more complex model of the heading.
