Composition of the 'Simulation_Case_8' closed loop simulation:

- The embedded final Guidance algorithm based on Waypoints following.
- The Control algorithm based on PD-Filtered control. No blocks, only embedded functions.
- The actuator model is based on a 'zero' order model of saturations. Again, no blocks and
  future embedded saturation function used.
- First order Nomoto model used for the system modelling. The physics being continuous: no
  discretization of the system dynamics. Switch from LTI to an LPV in the velocity.
- Very dimensionning 6° to 8° heading variation due to waves added to perturb the heading of 
  the system.
- Navigation: high pass filter in order to keep only the low frequency of the command, that shall
  only contain the perturbation due to waves. The resulting signal is then injected into
  a two-staged ARMA model allowing to estimate the frequency and damping of the waves.
  In parallel, EKF to fuse and filter measurements from Magnetometer, GPS and INS sensors.
  Therefore, use of the Heading filtered and the estimation of the parameters of the wave to obtain,
  through a Kalman Filter Estimator (KF linear), the components du to control and not the perturbed one.
- Velocity norm profile created "by-hands" in the kinematics propagation block. Some real profile
  shall be created in the next release of the simulator's version.

Neglected elements:

- More developped model of the actuators.

Conclusions:
------------

- A fine tuning of the global EKF has finally be found. It allows for the embedded 
  wave estimator afterward to estimate, in the good manner, the dynamics at low frequency
  of the ship corresponding to the one to send to the controller.

- Velocity norm profile has been manually created; they shall be automatically created in the
  next release. Note that whenever a too abrupt change in velocity is done, the control loop
  shall diverge: hence the need of creation of smoother ramp velocity profile.

- The controller, EKF and KF_Estimator work well using the LPV in velocity function and using
  the estimated velocity in output of the EKF.

- In the next releases: new discretization method will be test in the KF_Estimator, H_Infinity
  synthesis for Loop_Shaping of the ship frequency domain will then be used. Eventually, an
  MPC/Tube_MPC algorithm will be developped and tested and compared to the previous versions.
