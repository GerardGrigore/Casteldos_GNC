Composition of the 'Simulation_Case_6' closed loop simulation:

- This simulator contains approximately the same information and functionnalities than
  its previous version Simulator_Case_5. The novelty is in the wind perturbation addition
  and a wind estimator allowing to take into account the wind in the rudder action of 
  the corrector.

- An Optimal Linear Quadratic (LQ) was designed to allow a comparison with the PIDF
  controller type.

Neglected elements:

- No actuator model.

Conclusions:
------------

- LQ Controller used for tracking presents indeniably better performances than the PIDF controller.
  Additionnaly, the constraints of angular maximum/minimum and angular rate maximum/minimum for the 
  rudder are well respected. One can admire the quality of the filtered heading using the identification
  algorithm alongside with the Extended Kalman Filter.
