Composition of the 'Simulation_Case_3' closed loop simulation:

- Every blocks have been discretized and are called at the samplig period fixed
  in the beginning of the script Parametrization_Simulation_Case_3.m.
- The Guidance is in its simplest form possible: a step order heading aimed.
- The controller is a discrete-time tuned PIDF.
- A non-linearity was added to anticipate the actuator effect just after
  the controller: the amplitude of the rudder angle has been limited to around
  +-50Â°.
- The Navigation is supposed to be composed of a unique sensor returning the 
  total heading composed by a low frequency heading and a high wave-induced
  heading perturbation.
- A Kalman Filter embedding a model of the waves has been created in order to
  estimate the wave induced heading and to separate the real low frequency
  heading of the perturbed induced heading. It is supposed that the frequency
  (pulsation) and the damping factor of the waves are known. 

Neglected elements:

- The Guidance algorithm was omitted.
- The 2 DoF in position were avoided.
- The model of the sensors and actuators were omitted.
- An Identification (ARMA) method has been omitted (for the waves parameters).

The goal here was to really be able to tackle the problematic of wave perturbation
filtering to provide the automatic pilot with a realistic value of heading without
the wave components. It turns out that the algorithm performs very well, and one 
can see that the estimation of the wave perturbation is very close to the original
created waveform.

Conclusions:
------------

The estimation algorithm performs well in presence of a known wave perturbation 
(in terms of pulsation & damping factor) and a sensor noise. The control behaves 
healthily even with a saturation in the loop (but at a sufficiently high threshold).

The following points will be covered in the next simulation case:
- To the previously unique sensor (magnetic compass) returning the value of the heading,
  add the positions returned by the GPS. Hence; addition of the GPS model in the loop.
- Therefore, implement a non linear Kalman Filter (EKF) to account for the position
  filtering and estimation. This will result in an addition of 2 mode DoF.
- Addition of the Guidance algorithm in the loop.
- In the next simulation cases: ARMA identification algorithm to estimate, in function
  of heading measurements, the pulsation and damping factor of the wave model.
- For even further simulation case: adding the wind perturbation, a wind estimator and
  then account for the wind estimate in the structure of the controller.
