Composition of the 'Simulation_Case_1' closed loop simulation:

- Guidance Waypoints-based algorithm.
- Ideal Controller based only on a PIDF tuning: no actuators.
- First-order Nomoto ship model relating the rudder angle to the heading.
- Ideal Navigation: no sensors.
- Ideal environment: no perturbation considered.
- Continuous-time domain: no discretization.

Neglected elements:

- Perturbations: wind, waves & current.
- The actuator model.
- The sensor model.
- The filters.
- The non-linearities (such as actuator saturation).
- The discretization.

The goal here was to have a rapid look at the behaviour of the Guidance algorithm and be
able to tune a first version of the higher loop controller. 

Conclusions:
------------

Excellent behaviour of the control and quasi-perfect Guidance heading generation.
The goal of the Simulation_Case_2 will be to add to the loop the sensor models and
create the Kalman filter to clean and fuse the data. The perturbations will also
be added: the wind and the waves. Their effect will be studied.
